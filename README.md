BUSINESS CASH FLOW
By Matheus Souza de Macedo Santos

The "Business Cash Flow" project is a tool developed to assist in the efficient financial management of a company. Developed with the aim of facilitating the control of cash inflows and outflows, it provides a clear view of revenue and expenses, allowing for a precise analysis of the financial health of the business.

In addition to simplifying the tracking of cash flow, the project also aims to demonstrate the skills I acquired throughout the course "Excel - From Basic to Advanced," taught by Dr. NÃ©lio Alves, a doctor in Software Engineering. During the course, fundamental knowledge of spreadsheets was enhanced, and advanced techniques for data analysis were explored, making it possible to create effective and customized reports.

Various technical tools were used in the project, such as the use of macros, mathematical formulas like SUM and SUMIFS, statistical formulas like COUNT.VALUES and MAX, lookup and reference formulas like OFFSET, MATCH, and VLOOKUP, logical formula IF, pivot tables, and charts.

By adding the project to my portfolio, I highlight not only the ability to develop practical and functional solutions but also the direct application of acquired knowledge in a real business context. Through this initiative, I aim to demonstrate my aptitude in using technological tools to optimize processes, analyze data, and assist in companies' decision-making.

*Observations*

The repository contains three attached files, which are: the Excel file to execute the project, a PDF document with the project presentation, details of how it was created, and its functionalities, and another PDF document containing the code for all macros used in the xlms file.

To achieve the best performance of the project, I recommend reading the presentation before executing the Excel file, as this will give you a deeper understanding of each worksheet and its functions.

Upon entering Excel, click on the "Enable Content" option to activate the macros and ensure that the project works correctly. If you have any questions, I am available to help.

It is highly recommended to use Excel in English for the formulas to work correctly.
